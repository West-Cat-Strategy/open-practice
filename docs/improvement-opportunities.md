# Development Backlog

This document captures candidate opportunities for Open Practice. Use `docs/planning.md` for the
durable roadmap, `docs/planning-and-progress.md` for live workboard tasks, and `docs/archive/` for
completed proof. Items here are not active commitments until promoted to the live workboard.

Keep this file candidate-only: if a slice is already shipped, the archive owns the evidence and the
row should not stay here as future work.

## Candidate Backlog

These candidates name the next smallest useful unimplemented slice. Each row also states the shipped
surface it must not duplicate.

No active candidate rows are waiting here after OP-T109 through OP-T112. Add new candidate rows only
after confirming the next smallest unimplemented slice and the shipped surface it must not duplicate.

## Implementation Guardrails

- **Originality**: Keep Apache-2.0 core code original unless reuse passes
  `docs/reuse-decision-policy.md`.
- **Clean-Room Reference**: Treat AGPL/GPL/LGPL/EPL/source-available, mixed-license, and
  unclear-license projects as reference-only; do not fork or copy implementation.
- **Service Isolation**: Keep optional copyleft services in separate containers behind documented
  APIs.
- **Compliance**: Maintain cautious wording on records and withdrawals until jurisdiction-specific
  legal review is complete.
